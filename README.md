## 👨‍💻 Career path

I am now an undergraduate student at [Ton Duc Thang University](<https://www.tdtu.edu.vn/en>), where I am majoring in Software Engineering.

In the future, I hope to work as a data engineer. Furthermore, I aspire to be a data scientist.
I am really interested in data science and am continuously searching for new methods to better my abilities.

Python and SQL are two languages that I am familiar with. I also know how to write code in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

I've worked on Machine Learning, Data Crawling, Natural Language Processing, and Data Visualization projects.

I've worked on a number of projects in the past, you can take a look at my [repositories](https://github.com/khoilr?tab=repositories) and I'm always searching for new methods to better my abilities.
